---WEEK 4 DEVELOPMENT LOG---

-Added more structure to the GitHub repository ("checkpoints" and "training_graphs").
--The "checkpoints" folder is used to store models built in the the model build functions, and the "training_graphs" folder is used to store PyPlot graphs to determine the training of the model.
--Within the "training_graphs" folder there are subfolders that are used to separate the graphs for each model.
-Updated the build model scripts to perform transfer learning instead of building each model from scratch.
--This was done to prevent overfitting and greatly reduce the training time for each model.
-Built an initial model for EfficientNetV2S and ResNet50V2 and stored them in the "checkpoint folder."
--ConvNeXtTiny appears to work as well, but was not built as it was the one that takes the longest.
--I may rebuild these models for the final submission.
-Created PyPlot graphs for the EfficientNetV2S and ResNet50V2 models to show how the training went for both models.
--Both models show an accuracy above 95% which is a good sign.
