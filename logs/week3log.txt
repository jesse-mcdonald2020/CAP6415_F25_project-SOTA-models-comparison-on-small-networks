---WEEK 3 DEVELOPMENT LOG---

-Selected the other two models, ResNet50V2 and ConvNeXtTiny.
-Swapped from working with Jupyter Notebooks to Python scripts.
--I wanted to use notebooks because I was more familiar with them; but when I started to create a virtual environment, I thought it would be easier to use Python scripts.
-Set up the virtual environment and installed Tensorflow on it.
--The virtual environment is will not be shown in the repository.
-Created and made notable progress on the build scripts for each model.
--Documentation has been worked on for the scripts, but needs to be improved.
